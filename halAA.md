# halAncestralAllele Documentation

## Overview

`halAncestralAllele` is a tool for inferring ancestral alleles at specified genomic positions using whole genome alignments stored in the HAL (Hierarchical Alignment) format. The tool implements a multi-tiered approach to ancestral state reconstruction, attempting various strategies to maximize the recovery of ancestral information even in challenging alignment scenarios.

## Scientific Rationale

### Background

Ancestral allele inference is crucial for:
- Understanding evolutionary histories
- Polarizing mutations (determining ancestral vs derived states)
- Population genetics analyses (e.g., detecting selection)
- Phylogenetic reconstruction
- Understanding functional evolution of genomic elements

### Key Challenges Addressed

1. **Missing Orthologous Alignments**: Not all positions have direct 1:1 orthologous mappings
2. **Duplications and Paralogs**: Gene duplications complicate orthology determination
3. **Alignment Gaps**: Insertions/deletions create alignment discontinuities
4. **Multiple Possible Ancestors**: Different outgroup species may provide different quality information

## Algorithm Workflow

The tool implements a hierarchical fallback strategy with three main approaches:

### Step 1: Direct Orthologous Mapping
```
Reference Position → Column Iterator (no duplications) → Target Genome(s)
```
- Uses HAL's `ColumnIterator` with duplications disabled
- Searches for direct 1:1 orthologous positions
- Most reliable when successful

### Step 2: Ancestral Paralog Search
```
Reference Position → Column Iterator (duplications enabled) → Target Genome(s)
```
- Activated when direct mapping fails
- Uses `findParalogsInGenome()` function
- Searches for paralogous copies that may retain ancestral state
- Implements majority voting for multiple paralogs

### Step 3: Within-Species Paralog Search
```
Reference Position → Column Iterator (duplications enabled) → Reference Genome (self)
```
- Last resort when no cross-species information available
- Searches for paralogs within the reference genome itself
- Based on principle that duplicated sequences may preserve ancestral states

## Key Functions

### `main()` (lines 290-458)
- Entry point and orchestration
- Handles input parsing and file I/O
- Manages position sorting optimization
- Coordinates the search across multiple target genomes

### `findAncestralAllele()` (lines 122-288)
**Core algorithm implementation**

Parameters:
- `refGenome`: Reference genome containing query positions
- `absStart`: Absolute genomic position in reference
- `targetSets`: Sets of target genomes for ColumnIterator
- `targetGenomes`: Vector of target genome pointers
- `ancestorNames`: Names of ancestral genomes (for reporting)
- `ancAllele`: Output ancestral allele
- `evidence`: Output evidence type/quality
- `usedAncestor`: Output which ancestor provided the allele

Algorithm:
1. Iterate through each potential ancestor genome in order
2. Try direct orthologous lookup (duplications=false)
3. If no direct hit, try ancestral paralogs (duplications=true)
4. Apply majority voting for multiple hits
5. Fall back to within-species paralogs if needed
6. Track evidence quality and source

### `findParalogsInGenome()` (lines 62-120)
**Specialized paralog search with enhanced error handling**

Key features:
- Safety checks for null pointers
- Exception handling for HDF5 errors
- Uses ColumnIterator with duplications enabled
- Filters out gaps ('N', '-') and null bases

### `splitAncestors()` (lines 47-60)
- Parses comma-separated list of target genomes
- Enables fallback chain of multiple ancestors

### `parseLine()` (lines 38-45)
- BED/GFF file parser
- Extracts chromosome, start, end positions

## Evidence Types and Interpretation

### Direct Evidence
- `Direct`: Found direct 1:1 ortholog
- `Direct@GenomeName`: Specifies which genome (when multiple tried)

### Paralog-Based Evidence
- `AncestralParalog`: Single paralog found in ancestor
- `AncestralParalogVote:A=3,T=1`: Multiple paralogs with vote counts
- `WithinSpeciesParalog`: Used reference genome's own paralogs
- `WithinSpeciesParalogVote`: Majority vote from reference paralogs

### Ambiguous/Missing Evidence
- `AncestralParalogTie`: Equal votes for multiple alleles → returns 'N'
- `WithinSpeciesParalogTie`: Tie in reference paralogs → returns 'N'
- `Missing`: No alignment found
- `Missing(tried:N+self)`: Attempted N ancestors plus self-paralogs

## Output Format

Tab-delimited with columns:
1. **Chromosome**: Reference sequence name
2. **Start**: 0-based start position
3. **End**: 0-based end position (typically start+1)
4. **Reference Allele**: Base in reference genome
5. **Used Ancestor**: Which genome provided the ancestral allele
6. **Ancestral Allele**: Inferred ancestral base (or 'N' if unknown)
7. **Evidence**: Type and quality of evidence

Example:
```
ptg000001l	10247	10248	A	Anc05	C	Direct@Anc05
ptg000001l	16863	16864	C	WithinSpecies	C	WithinSpeciesParalog
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
halAncestralAllele alignment.hal refGenome ancestorGenome positions.bed output.tsv
```

### Multiple Fallback Ancestors
```bash
halAncestralAllele alignment.hal human "chimp,gorilla,orangutan" positions.bed output.tsv
```

### With Progress Reporting
```bash
halAncestralAllele alignment.hal refGenome ancestor positions.bed output.tsv --progress 1000
```

### Preserve Input Order
```bash
halAncestralAllele alignment.hal refGenome ancestor positions.bed output.tsv --noSort
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Position Sorting**: By default, sorts positions by chromosome and coordinate for better cache locality
2. **Batch Processing**: Processes all positions before output to enable sorting
3. **Result Caching**: Stores results to restore original order after sorted processing
4. **Progress Reporting**: Optional progress updates for large datasets

## Scientific Defensibility

### Strengths

1. **Multi-tiered Approach**: Maximizes data recovery through fallback strategies
2. **Transparent Evidence**: Reports exact evidence type for each inference
3. **Majority Voting**: Reduces noise from alignment errors
4. **Paralog Utilization**: Leverages duplicated sequences that may preserve ancestral states
5. **Multiple Ancestor Support**: Can use multiple outgroups in priority order

### Considerations and Limitations

1. **Paralog Assumption**: Assumes paralogs may retain ancestral state (generally valid for recent duplications)
2. **Majority Vote Bias**: Could be influenced by duplication burst events
3. **Within-Species Paralogs**: Less reliable than cross-species comparisons
4. **No Phylogenetic Weighting**: Treats all target genomes equally (could weight by distance)

### Recommended Best Practices

1. **Use Multiple Outgroups**: Provide comma-separated list ordered by reliability
2. **Validate Critical Positions**: Check evidence types for important variants
3. **Filter by Evidence**: Consider filtering results by evidence quality
4. **Cross-Validation**: Compare with other ancestral reconstruction methods when possible

## Potential Improvements

### Algorithm Enhancements
1. **Phylogenetic Distance Weighting**: Weight votes by evolutionary distance
2. **Alignment Quality Scores**: Incorporate alignment confidence metrics
3. **Context-Aware Inference**: Consider neighboring positions for ambiguous cases

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **Memory Management**: The current implementation stores all results in memory - could stream for very large datasets
2. **Parallel Processing**: Could parallelize across chromosomes or position chunks
3. **Configuration File**: Allow specification of voting thresholds and evidence priorities

### Error Handling
- The code includes comprehensive error handling for HDF5 failures
- Graceful fallbacks when genomes or sequences not found
- Safe handling of null pointers and invalid positions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Validation Dataset**: Use simulated evolution with known ancestral states
2. **Cross-Method Comparison**: Compare with parsimony/ML reconstruction methods
3. **Edge Cases**: Test with highly duplicated regions, alignment gaps, missing data
4. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark on genome-scale datasets

## Within-Species Paralog Search: Detailed Analysis

### How It Works

The within-species paralog search is invoked as a **last resort** when no cross-species ancestral information is available. Here's the detailed mechanism:

1. **Invocation Context** (lines 235-237):
   - Called after all target genomes have been tried unsuccessfully  
   - Uses `findParalogsInGenome(refGenome, absStart, refGenome, refParalogs)`
   - Note: Both source and target are the reference genome itself

2. **Search Mechanism** (lines 62-125):
   - Creates a `ColumnIterator` with duplications enabled (`dupeMode = true`)
   - Target set contains only the reference genome
   - The iterator finds ALL alignments at the query position including paralogous/duplicated sequences

3. **Circular Reasoning Prevention**:
   - **Key Fix**: The query position itself is excluded from results (lines 109-113)
   - `if (refGenome == targetGenome && foundPos == absStart) continue;`
   - This prevents using the reference base to infer its own ancestral state

4. **Base Collection & Voting**:
   - Collects bases only from TRUE paralogs (excluding self)
   - Filters out gaps ('N'), deletions ('-'), and null characters
   - Uses majority voting when multiple paralogs found
   - Reports ties as 'N' with detailed vote counts

### Scientific Validity

**Design Philosophy**: Within-species paralogs are used only as a **fallback strategy** when cross-species alignment fails. This prioritizes:

1. **Reliability over Coverage**: Cross-species orthologs are more reliable for ancestral inference
2. **Conservative Approach**: Only uses within-species information when no better option exists  
3. **Transparency**: Clear evidence reporting shows when fallback methods were used

**When Within-Species Search Is Used**:
- All target ancestor genomes fail to provide alignments
- No cross-species orthologous information available
- As a last resort to recover some ancestral information

**Evidence Types from Within-Species Search**:
- `WithinSpeciesParalog`: Single paralog found (excluding query position)
- `WithinSpeciesParalogVote`: Multiple paralogs with majority vote
- `WithinSpeciesParalogTie`: Equal votes → returns 'N'

### Implementation Details

**Key Code Fix** in `findParalogsInGenome()` function at lines 109-113:
```cpp
// Exclude query position from within-species searches to prevent circular reasoning
if (refGenome == targetGenome && foundPos == absStart) {
    continue;  // Skip the query position itself
}
```

**Algorithm Flow**:
1. When doing within-species paralog search (`refGenome == targetGenome`)
2. ColumnIterator finds all positions that align to the query (including self + paralogs)  
3. For each found position, check if it matches the query position
4. Skip query position itself to avoid circular reasoning
5. Collect bases only from TRUE paralogs (different genomic positions)

**Result**: Clean separation between self-alignment and true paralogous sequences

## Final Summary
